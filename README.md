## AltUp

This is a little package that will look for the next empty line and then bring you to the next line. The reason for this is that this will allow you to jump from method to method in most programming languages with a one-line space between them. In any case it brings more power to the arrow navigation system.

This behaviour is based on a script to run multiple commands on sublime written by https://github.com/nilium/.
